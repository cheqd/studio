## ℹ️ Overview

cheqd Studio (formerly known as Credential Service) enables users to consume cheqd's identity functionality, such as DIDs, Trust Registries, Status Lists, Credential Payments and DID-Linked Resources over REST API. This enables users to integrate cheqd's functionality into existing applications or create a full end-to-end trusted ecosystem from the ground up.

Get started by setting up your cheqd Studio account below:
- [Setup cheqd Studio account](https://cheqd.io/solutions/cheqd-studio/)
- [cheqd Studio docs and tutorials](https://docs.cheqd.io/product/getting-started/studio)

## 📖 Usage

We run hosted endpoints for this package (in case you don't want to run it yourself) which have Swagger / OpenAPI
definition endpoints that list all of the APIs and how they work.

The Swagger API definition pages are:

- [Production / Stable Release APIs](https://studio-api.cheqd.net/swagger/)
- [Staging / Development Release APIs](https://studio-api-staging.cheqd.net/swagger/)

## 🔧 Configuration

The application allows configuring the following parameters using environment variables.

### Core configuration

#### Events tracking

1. `LOG_LEVEL`: specifies log level, like 'trace', 'debug', 'info', 'warn' or 'error';

#### Network API endpoints

1. `MAINNET_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint for cheqd mainnet (Default: `https://rpc.cheqd.net:443`).
2. `TESTNET_RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint for cheqd testnet (Default: `https://rpc.cheqd.network:443`).
3. `RESOLVER_URL`: API endpoint for a [DID Resolver](https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver) endpoint that supports
   `did:cheqd` (Default: `https://resolver.cheqd.net/1.0/identifiers/`).
4. `APPLICATION_BASE_URL`: URL of the application (external domain name).
5. `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: CORS allowed origins used in the app (optional). (Default: `APPLICATION_BASE_URL`).

#### Veramo KMS Database

The application supports two modes in which keys are managed: either just storing them in-memory while a container is
running, or persisting them in a PostgresSQL database with Veramo SDK. Using an external Postgres database allows for
"custodian" mode where identity and cheqd/Cosmos keys can be offloaded by client applications to be stored in the
database.

By default, `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DB` is set to off/`false`. To enable external Veramo KMS database, set `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DB`
to `true`, then define below environment variables in `.env` file:

1. `EXTERNAL_DB_CONNECTION_URL`: PostgreSQL database connection URL, e.g.
   `postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`.
2. `EXTERNAL_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Secret key used to encrypt the Veramo key-specific database tables. This adds a layer
   of protection by not storing the database in plaintext.
3. `EXTERNAL_DB_CERTIFICATE`: Custom CA certificate required to connect to the database (optional).

#### API Authentication using LogTo

By default, the application has API authentication disabled (which can be changed in configuration). If, however, you'd
like to run the app with API authentication features, the following variables need to be configured.

We use a self-hosted version of [LogTo](https://logto.io/), which supports OpenID Connect. Theoretically, these values
could also be replaced with [LogTo Cloud](http://cloud.logto.io/) or any other OpenID Connect identity provider.

By default, `ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION` is set to off/`false`. To enable external Veramo KMS database, set
`ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION` to `true`, then define below environment variables in `.env` file:

1. **Endpoints**
    1. `LOGTO_ENDPOINT`: API endpoint for LogTo server
    2. `LOGTO_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_URL`: Root of API resources in this application to be guarded. (Default:
       `http://localhost:3000/` on localhost.)
    3. `LOGTO_MANAGEMENT_API`: URL of management API for LogTo. This is typically static within self-hosted LogTo applications and is not meant to be a resolvable URL. (Default: `https://default.logto.app/api`)
2. **User-facing APIs**
    1. `LOGTO_APP_ID`: Application ID for the cheqd Studio application in LogTo. This can be set up as type
       "Traditional Web"
    2. `LOGTO_APP_SECRET`: Application secret associated with App ID above.
3. **Machine-to-machine backend APIs**
    1. `LOGTO_M2M_APP_ID`: Application ID for machine-to-machine application in LogTo. This is used for elevated
       management APIs within LogTo.
    2. `LOGTO_M2M_APP_SECRET`: Application secret
4. **Default role update using [LogTo webhooks](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/webhooks/)**: LogTo supports
   webhooks to fire of requests to an API when it detects certain actions/changes. If you want to automatically assign a
   role to users, a webhook is recommended to be setup for firing off whenever there's a new account created, or a new
   sign-in.
    1. `LOGTO_DEFAULT_ROLE_ID`: LogTo Role ID for the default role to put new users into.
    2. `LOGTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Webhook secret to authenticate incoming webhook requests from LogTo.
5. **Miscellaneous**
    1. `COOKIE_SECRET`: Secret for cookie encryption.
    2. `API_KEY_EXPIRATION` (optional): Expiration time for API keys in days. (Default 30 days)

#### Faucet settings

This section describes bootstrapping things for newcomers accounts. If it's enabled cheqd Studio auto-populates
some tokens on the testnet for making the process simpler.

1. `ENABLE_ACCOUNT_TOPUP`: Enable/disable such functionality (`false` by default)
2. `FAUCET_URI`: Faucet service API endpoint (Default: `https://faucet-api.cheqd.network/credit`)
3. `TESTNET_MINIMUM_BALANCE`: Minimum balance on account before it is automatically topped up from the faucet. This value should be expressed as an integer in `CHEQ` tokens, which will then be converted in the background to `ncheq` denomination. Account balance check is carried out on every account creation/login. (Default: 10,000 CHEQ testnet tokens)

#### Stripe integration

The application supports Stripe integration for payment processing.

1. `STRIPE_ENABLED` - Enable/disable Stripe integration (`false` by default)
2. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for Stripe API. Please, keep it secret on deploying
3. `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Publishable key for Stripe API.
4. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret for Stripe Webhook.
5. `STRIPE_BUILD_PLAN_ID` - Subscription planId of Build plan
6. `STRIPE_TEST_PLAN_ID` -  Subscription planId of Test plan

### 3rd Party Connectors

The app supports 3rd party connectors for credential storage and delivery.

#### Verida

The app's [Verida Network](https://www.verida.network/) connector can be enabled to deliver generated credentials to
Verida Wallet.

By default, `ENABLE_VERIDA_CONNECTOR` is set to off/`false`. To enable external Veramo KMS database, set
`ENABLE_VERIDA_CONNECTOR` to `true`, then define below environment variables in `.env` file:

1. `VERIDA_PRIVATE_KEY`: Secret key for Verida Network API.
2. `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY`: Secret key for Polygon Network.

## 🧑‍💻🛠 Developer Guide

### Run as standalone application using Docker Compose

If you want to run the application without any external databases or dependent services, we provide
[a Docker Compose file](docker/no-external-db/docker-compose-no-db.yml) to spin up a standalone service.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/no-external-db/docker-compose-no-db.yml up --detach
```

This standalone service uses an in-memory database with no persistence, and therefore is recommended only if you're
managing key/secret storage separately.

The [`no-db.env` file](docker/no-external-db/no-db.env) in the same folder contains all the environment variables
necessary to configure the service. (See section _Configuration_ above.)

### Run with external Key Management System (KMS) and/or authentication service using Docker Compose

Construct the postgres URL and configure the env variables mentioned above.

Spinning up a Docker container from the
[pre-built studio Docker image on Github](https://github.com/cheqd/studio/pkgs/container/studio)
is as simple as the command below:

#### Configure PostgreSQL database

Configure the environment variables in the [`postgres.env` file](docker/with-external-db/postgres.env):

1. `POSTGRES_USER`: Username for Postgres database
2. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password for Postgres database
3. `POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES`: Database names for multiple databases in the same cluster, e.g.: `"app,logto"`. This
   sets up multiple databases in the same cluster, which can be used independently for External Veramo KMS or LogTo
   service.

Then, make the Postgres initialisation scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x docker/with-external-db/pg-init-scripts/create-multiple-postgresql-databases.sh
```

#### Start LogTo service

Configure the environment variables in the [`logto.env` file](docker/with-external-db/logto.env) with the settings
described in section above.

Then, run the LogTo service to configure the LogTo application API resources, applications, sign-in experiences, roles
etc using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/with-external-db/docker-compose-with-db.yml --profile logto up --detach
```

Configuring LogTo is outside the scope of this guide, and we recommend reading
[LogTo documentation](https://docs.logto.io/) to familiarise yourself.

#### Start studio app

Configure the environment variables in the [`with-db.env` file](docker/with-external-db/with-db.env) with the settings
described in section above. Depending on whether you are using external Veramo KMS only, LogTo only, or both you will
need to have previously provisioned these services as there are environment variables in this file that originate from
Postgres/LogTo.

Then, start the service using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/with-external-db/docker-compose-with-db.yml up --detach
```

#### Running app or LogTo migrations

When upgrading either the external Veramo KMS or LogTo, you might need to run migrations for the underlying databases.

You can run _just_ the migration scripts using [Docker Compose profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/)
defined in the Compose file.

For example, to run cheqd Studio app migrations on an existing Postgres database (for external Veramo KMS):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/with-external-db/docker-compose-with-db.yml --profile app-setup up --detach
```

Or to run LogTo migrations on an existing Postgres database:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/with-external-db/docker-compose-with-db.yml --profile logto-setup up --detach
```

### Build using Docker

To build your own image using Docker, use the [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) provided.

```bash
docker build --file docker/Dockerfile --target runner . --tag studio:local
```
